This replacement part is made out of rubber, which helps create a seal between the element and the appliance. This grommet is sold individually. If you are replacing the heating element, or the brass nut that holds it in place, we recommend you replace the grommet at the same time. Before you begin any repair work on your dishwasher, make sure you have unplugged it and shut off the water supply.",

Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly.

To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before.

To remove the shaft seal, consult your user guide for specific instructions. Start by shutting off the power and water supply. Remove the water hoses and drain hose, being cautious of any water that may leak out. You will need tools like a putty knife, screwdriver, nut driver, pliers, spanner, plastic mallet, and a socket set. Open the lid and proceed to remove the agitator assembly, detach the control panel, and disconnect any necessary wiring harnesses. Remove the cabinet and water break. Continue disassembling the inner tub until you can lift it out of the appliance and tilt it onto its back, propping it up with a block. This will allow access to the transmission assembly from beneath the appliance. Remove the mounting fasteners on the pump to reach the motor assembly. Once the motor assembly is out, further disassemble it to access the basket drive. The seal can be removed from the top of the shaft of the drive tube, below the thrust ring.

    "description": "This OEM upper transmission shaft seal, also known as the oil seal, is found in your washers and dryers. It acts as a barrier to prevent water from leaking into the transmission assembly. It measures 1/2 inch in height with a 1-inch diameter, and is located at the top of the transmission shaft where it enters the tub. Signs of a broken seal include water stains, dampness, or pooling of water beneath the appliance. If left unreplaced, it can result in water damage to internal components, along with the potential for corrosion, mold growth, and unpleasant odors. To remove the shaft seal, consult your user guide for specific instructions. Start by shutting off the power and water supply. Remove the water hoses and drain hose, being cautious of any water that may leak out. You will need tools like a putty knife, screwdriver, nut driver, pliers, spanner, plastic mallet, and a socket set. Open the lid and proceed to remove the agitator assembly, detach the control panel, and disconnect any necessary wiring harnesses. Remove the cabinet and water break. Continue disassembling the inner tub until you can lift it out of the appliance and tilt it onto its back, propping it up with a block. This will allow access to the transmission assembly from beneath the appliance. Remove the mounting fasteners on the pump to reach the motor assembly. Once the motor assembly is out, further disassemble it to access the basket drive. The seal can be removed from the top of the shaft of the drive tube, below the thrust ring. When purchasing parts for your appliance repair, it is important to remember that your appliance uses various seals and gaskets. It is important to ensure that you purchase the correct part when making repairs.",

Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in.

A worn or damaged gasket can lead to water pooling, inefficient washing, and potential damage to surrounding cabinetry. Replacing it restores proper function and helps extend the appliance\u2019s lifespan. Installation is straightforward, requiring the gasket to be pressed into the door channel for a snug fit.",
