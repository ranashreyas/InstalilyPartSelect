    "description": "This ice cube tray is located inside your refrigerator and is eleven inches long, with 48 molds. It comes in white and is made entirely from plastic. If your tray is broken, cracked, or damaged, replacing this part can solve the problem. Here are some ice cube tray tips to consider: the easiest way to release the cubes is by giving the tray a twisting motion from both sides. If that does not work, set it on your counter for a couple minutes until the tray warms up and it should work. Remember not to beat the tray, especially on a hard surface, to prevent damage. Refer to manual instructions provided by the manufacturer if needed.",

If your tray is broken, cracked, or damaged, replacing this part can solve the problem. Here are some ice cube tray tips to consider: the easiest way to release the cubes is by giving the tray a twisting motion from both sides. If that does not work, set it on your counter for a couple minutes until the tray warms up and it should work. Remember not to beat the tray, especially on a hard surface, to prevent damage. Refer to manual instructions provided by the manufacturer if needed.",

    "description": "This ice cube tray is located inside your refrigerator and is eleven inches long, with 48 molds. It comes in white and is made entirely from plastic. If your tray is broken, cracked, or damaged, replacing this part can solve the problem. Here are some ice cube tray tips to consider: the easiest way to release the cubes is by giving the tray a twisting motion from both sides. If that does not work, set it on your counter for a couple minutes until the tray warms up and it should work. Remember not to beat the tray, especially on a hard surface, to prevent damage. Refer to manual instructions provided by the manufacturer if needed.",

It allows the compressor in your appliance to easily cycle on and off. This capacitor mounts directly onto the compressor starting relay. If the capacitor is faulty the compressor may get unusually hot and draw excessive amperage. It the compressor overheats, it may fail to run until it cools down again. The compressor may also get noisy from overheating.  If this part is totally electrically open, it is defective (often due to overheating) and needs to be replaced. The part measures 1 inch by 1-1/2 inches, and is constructed of plastic with two metal wire terminals. This item includes 1 capacitor, sold individually. This part comes in black.",

If your tray is broken, cracked, or damaged, replacing this part can solve the problem. Here are some ice cube tray tips to consider: the easiest way to release the cubes is by giving the tray a twisting motion from both sides. If that does not work, set it on your counter for a couple minutes until the tray warms up and it should work. Remember not to beat the tray, especially on a hard surface, to prevent damage. Refer to manual instructions provided by the manufacturer if needed.",

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions",

Wear work gloves to protect your hands. The thermistor itself, part WPW10383615, should test at these Ohms depending on temperature. It's recommended to test at room temperature and again in a glass of ice water to make sure it's sensing temperatures properly. So it should read around 3000 - 5000 Ohms at room temperature 7000 - 10000 Ohms at 0\u00b0C and 20000 Ohms at -15\u00b0C.",
